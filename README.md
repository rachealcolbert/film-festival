# Movie Search
As a person who loves movies, I want a website where I can see the top trending movies and search a large movide database. I can then save movies to my profile to watch later!

## Description
When I visit the homepage, I first see the top 3 trending movies. I can then search the database to find any movie I like. When I find a movie I like or hope to watch in the future, I can save it to my profile. 

When I visit my profile, I can see all my saved movies and remove any that I want.
